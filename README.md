## 💻 Description

A web-app for experimenting and creating finite state automatas. 
I was inspired on making this project when I thought of making a web version for JFLAP

## 🔎 Features

* Supports Regular FAs, Nondeterministic FAs and e-NFAs
* Creating nodes, creating edges, and deleting elements by just interacting with the canvas
* Test string on the created FSA
* Animation speed slider

## 🔭 Possible Additions
-  Pushdown Automaton Simulator
-  Turing Machine Simulator

If there's any features you can suggest, feel free to let me know

## ❤️ Special Thanks

JFLAP for being the inspiration for this project
